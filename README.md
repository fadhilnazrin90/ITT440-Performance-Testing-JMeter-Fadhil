Summary
This project evaluates the performance of test.k6.io using Apache JMeter through three testing methods:
- Load Test (50 users, 20s ramp, 2min)
- Stress Test (200 users, 10s ramp, 2min)
- Spike Test (200 users instant, 2min)

  Analysis includes response time, throughput, samples count, error rate, and behaviour under traffic surge.

  Findings
  - All test resulted in 0% error
  - Application is stable under heavy load
  - Spike test shows highest latency but still recovered
  - Server performs well and scalable
 
  Conclusion
  test.k6.io is reliable and performs well under normal and heavy conditions. JMeter successfully provided performance insights through Load, Stress, and Spike testing.
